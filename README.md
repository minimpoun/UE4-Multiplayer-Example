# UE4 Multiplayer Example is a Open-Source example of how to create multiplayer games using UE4 C++

# I lost the source code for this project a while back, but I am starting it up again. https://github.com/minimpoun/UE4-Multiplayer-YouTube-Project
## The new project is going to be more focused on teaching than it is just showing off that I know what I am doing. 

The goal of this project is to show off my skills in Network Programming with UE4, as well as give the community 
an excellent example of how to create a multiplayer game. I know Epic has released things like this of their own,
however I plan on providing extensive documentation as well as a video series.

*Why are you giving this away for free?*  
**This is going to act as my go-to work example for my portfolio. So I would be doing this regardless.**
**However, I'm giving it away for free because the UE4 community lacks good examples of multiplayer and Steam Integration.**
**Most of the tutorials on the internet for multiplayer are awful, and I'm hoping to change that.**
