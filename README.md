# UE4 Multiplayer Example is a Open-Source example of how to create multiplayer games using UE4 C++

# This project is no longer being developed.

The goal of this project is to show off my skills in Network Programming with UE4, as well as give the community 
an excellent example of how to create a multiplayer game. I know Epic has released things like this of their own,
however I plan on providing extensive documentation as well as a video series.

*Why are you giving this away for free?*  
**This is going to act as my go-to work example for my portfolio. So I would be doing this regardless.**
**However, I'm giving it away for free because the UE4 community lacks good examples of multiplayer and Steam Integration.**
**Most of the tutorials on the internet for multiplayer are awful, and I'm hoping to change that.**
